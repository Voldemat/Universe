    test_about_me = 'Albert Einstein \
    (14 March 1879 â€“ 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,[5] widely \
    acknowledged to be one of the greatest physicists of all time. \
    Einstein is known for developing the theory of relativity,\
     but he also made important contributions to the development \
     of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum \
     mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics.'
